# Matplotlib Homework

This repo contains my code for the matplotlib homework assignment from UC Berkeley Extension's Data Analytics Bootcamp. It contains analysis of two datasets having to do with the testing of cancer drugs on mice, with Tumor Volume (measured in cubic millimeters) being the main variable we are analyzing. 

The exercise is meant to help students practice using pandas and matplotlib for data manipulation and plotting different charts including bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, box plots, scatter plots, and linear regression lines.
